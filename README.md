### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Caio Freitas](https://caio-freitas.github.io/), currently diving deep into diffusion models and graph neural networks, aiming to apply these advanced techniques for imitation learning in robotics ðŸ¤–. I'm pursuing a double degree (bachelor's + master's) in Control and Automation Engineering through a collaboration between the Brazilian University of Sao Paulo and the German TU Darmstadt ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. 

I'm passionate about collaborating on innovative robotics projects and love discussing all things related to machine learning and drones. If you're interested in these topics or have a project in mind, feel free to reach out to me at caiofreitas@usp.br.
